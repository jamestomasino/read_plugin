#### Features

This tool handles all of the parsing and display logic on the client-side. There is no dictionary look-up or database of words referenced. Everything is parsed by regular expressions. Even with these limitations, read offers some unique features.

##### RSVP 

Rapid serial visual presentation allows for readers to keep their eyes focused on a single point on the page, saving a massive amount of time normally lost in reading. As the speed of this serial presentation increases, sub-vocalization also decreases and astounding speeds can be reached with great comprehension.

##### Alignment

When the eyes read a word, there is an optimal focal point placement around 30% into the word to support easiest understanding. We handle this shift in the alignment of the words for you based on the word length.

##### Timing

Speed reading via RSVP is all about the timing. How long we display any given word can have a massive impact on the reading experience. Here's a few ways we optimize that experience.

##### Word Length

Contrary to expectations, reading small words can actually be more difficult than reading words of medium length. Long words also take a longer time to process. These extra delays are built into our rendering code.

##### Punctuation

When you encounter a period, question mark, exclamation point or other punctuation, additional time is provided to process the sentence or fragment. This helps avoid the feeling of a run-on sentence.

##### Paragraphs

The tool also gives an additional pause between paragraphs to help contextualize and process information as you read it.
